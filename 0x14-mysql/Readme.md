When working with databases, it can be useful to have multiple copies of your data. This provides redundancy in case one of the database servers fails and can improve a databaseâ€™s availability, scalability, and overall performance. The practice of synchronizing data across multiple separate databases is called replication.

MySQL is a relational database management system, and is the most popular open-source relational database in the world today. It comes installed with a number of built-in replication features, allowing you to maintain multiple copies of your data.

This tutorial outlines how to configure a MySQL instance on one server as a source database and then configure a MySQL instance on another server to function as its replica. It also includes an overview of how MySQL handles replication.
