Debugging is pretty much about verifying assumptions, in a perfect world the software or system we are working on would be working perfectly, the server is in perfect shape and everybody is happy. But actually, it NEVER goes this way, things ALWAYS fail (it’s tremendous!).

For the machine level, you want to ask yourself these questions:

Does the server have free disk space? - df
Is the server able to keep up with CPU load? - w, top, ps
Does the server have available memory? free
Are the server disk(s) able to keep up with read/write IO? - htop
If the answer is no for any of these questions, then that might be the reason why things are not going as expected. There are often 3 ways of solving the issue:

free up resources (stop process(es) or reduce their resource consumption)
increase the machine resources (adding memory, CPU, disk space…)
distributing the resource usage to other machines
