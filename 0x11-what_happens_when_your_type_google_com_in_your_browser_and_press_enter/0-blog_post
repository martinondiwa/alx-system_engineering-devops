Typing https://www.google.com triggers a complex process. First, a DNS request finds Google's IP address.  Then, TCP/IP establishes a connection.  A firewall checks the traffic. HTTPS/SSL encrypts communication. A load balancer distributes requests across servers. A web server receives the request, often passing it to an application server which may interact with a database. Finally, the web server sends the generated HTML back to your browser, displaying the Google search page.  This all happens in milliseconds.
